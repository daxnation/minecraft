## Minecraft Mods
In this section you can find a couple of mods that you can apply to Minecraft to expose some additional performance and visual tweaks (OptiFine) and some texture packs that Garak (and maybe others!) are using that have little to no performance impact.

### OptiFine
OptiFine is a mod for Minecraft that exposes additional performance and graphical tweaks in the Video Settings menu, allows for the use of more complex texture packs, the ability to apply shaders (which are a huge performance hog but look GREAT), and many under the hood tweaks to improve performance of the OpenGL engine that Minecraft uses. Please see the following instructions for installing OptiFine.
  1. If you haven't done so already. open the Minecraft Launcher and run your current installation of Minecraft. You can quit once it gets to the main menu.
  2. If you haven't done so already, download and install the latest version of the Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from Oracle's website [from this link](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp). Most of us are on 64-bit computers these days, so you will almost certainly want to download the `Windows Offline (64-bit)` version of the installer.
  3. Run the Java JRE executable and follow the on-screen instructions to install the latest Java JRE.
  4. Once you have the latest Java JRE installed, you will need to download OptiFine. Go to the [Optifine Download page](https://www.optifine.net/downloads).
  5. On the download page, the developer has breakout lists for several different versions. At time of writing, we are on Minecraft 1.17.1, so expand the list for that Minecraft version and download the latest package (if you have ad blockers enabled like I do, I find that the `Mirror` link works best for me).
  * **NOTE: The developer is working on preview versions for 1.17.1 (as of July 2021) and releases new builds every few days with new features and fixes, so check back every few days for the latest updates!**
  6. Open the folder where OptiFine was just downloaded.
  * If the icon is a Java icon, you can double click on it and it will open and run.
  * If it does NOT have a Java icon, hold the shift key and right click in any blank space of the window. Then click `Open Command Prompt Window Here` or `Open PowerShell Window Here` depending on your version of Windows. Type the command `java -jre name_of_file.jar` and hit enter to run the installer.
  * On a Mac on in Linux, you will have to open a Terminal and navigate to the OptiFine download folder and run the same `java -jre name_of_file.jar` command.
  7. Once the OptiFine installer is open, you should just be able to click `Install` with the default path it detects for Minecraft.
  8. A success window will appear when the installation is complete, click `OK` and the installer will close.
  9. The next time you open the Minecraft Launcher, a new OptiFine installation will appear under `Installations`. Click `Play` by that installation and accept the warning that the launcher pops up regarding 3rd party mods.
  10. You are now running Minecraft modded with OptiFine!
